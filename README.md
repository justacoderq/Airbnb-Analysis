# Airbnb Analysis using Tableau

## Overview
This project utilizes the Airbnb 2016 dataset to explore key trends in the Airbnb market. By analyzing listings, prices, availability, and reviews, we gain insights into customer behavior, host performance, and potential business opportunities. The analysis includes data visualization in Tableau and Python.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of three sheets:
1. **Calendar** - Information on pricing and availability for listings.
2. **Listings** - Detailed data on individual Airbnb listings.
3. **Reviews** - Customer reviews for each listing.

## Project Structure
- **Data Exploration**: Initial analysis of the dataset, checking for missing values, data types, and descriptive statistics.
- **Data Visualization**: Using Tableau and Python to visualize patterns and insights.
- **Opinion and Conclusion**: Personal observations based on data trends.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, WordCloud, Folium
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **Excel**: For initial data loading and inspection.

## Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and clean the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand distributions, trends, and relationships.
3. **Visualizations**: Create charts and graphs to highlight key insights.

## Key Insights
- **Pricing Trends**: Examined average prices across different room types.
- **Availability Patterns**: Identified how availability fluctuates over time.
- **Review Sentiments**: Generated word clouds from review text to understand guest feedback.
